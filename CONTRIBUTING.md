# How to contribute

You can help add languages to the list in two ways:

- The easy way: Open a [new issue](https://github.com/ETHproductions/golfing-langs/issues/new), title it **Add MyLang** (with the actual name of the language) and fill out the information.
- The better way: Fork this repo, add the information directly into the table, and submit a pull request with the name **Add MyLang**. You can add multiple languages at once if you wish.

Before you do either of these things, **please make sure the language is actually designed for golfing.** This list is for golfing languages only, not just any esolangs.

Feel free to contribute in other ways as well.
